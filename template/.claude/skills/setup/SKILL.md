name: setup
description: Slash command only — /setup — prepares a project that this template was just copied into. The project's technical files must already exist. It interviews the user, checks the answers against the code, and writes docs/architecture.md, docs/project-phase-plan.md and CLAUDE.md (from claude-template.md). Do not trigger from plain conversation without /setup.

# setup

## What this does

Setup writes a well-written `CLAUDE.md` (the project's instruction file
for Claude) and the design docs it builds on. It doesn't create the
project's technical files: that is scaffolding, and you do it yourself
first.

**Before you run it:**

1. Scaffold the project, e.g. with a command from `scaffolding.md` in
   the template repo, or start from a project that already has code.
2. Install the template: copy the *contents* of the template repo's
   `template/` folder (including the hidden `.claude/` folder) into the
   project root, using the install command in the template repo's
   README.
3. Run `/setup` once.

**What it does:**

1. Checks that the project has its technical files, and stops if it
   doesn't.
2. Looks at the project's files to learn what it is and how it runs,
   including any `CLAUDE.md` or design docs the project already has.
3. Asks you about the app in three short rounds: what it does, its data
   and rules, and its shape and scope. It checks your answers against the
   code and points out where they differ. Then it shows you a summary to
   confirm.
4. Writes `docs/architecture.md`, a snapshot of the design used for
   orientation, and `docs/project-phase-plan.md`, the high-level
   blueprint of what gets built in which phase.
5. Writes `CLAUDE.md`, using `claude-template.md` as its layout. An old
   `CLAUDE.md` is replaced, but its useful information is carried over.
6. Tells you what it did and what to do next.

It doesn't install, run or commit anything.

## Steps

Do these in order. Write every message to the user in plain language:
no jargon, or explain it in a few words when it can't be avoided.

### 1. Check the template is there

If `claude-template.md` doesn't exist in the project root, tell the user
the template folder wasn't copied in fully, and stop.

### 2. Check the project has its technical files

List the project root, including hidden files. If it holds nothing but:

- template files: `.claude/`, `claude-context/`, `claude-template.md`
- harmless extras: `.git/`, `.DS_Store`, `README.md`, `.gitignore`,
  `LICENSE`, an empty `docs/`

then the project hasn't been scaffolded yet. Tell the user to scaffold it
first: run the scaffold command for their project type from
`scaffolding.md` in the template repo (it creates a new project folder),
install the template into that folder, and run `/setup` there. Then stop.

### 3. Look at the project

Read the files that show what the project is and how it runs. Start with
the existing `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/architecture.md` and
`docs/project-phase-plan.md`, if there are any, then for example:
`README.md`, dependency files (`package.json`, `pyproject.toml`,
`requirements.txt`, `Gemfile`, `go.mod`, …), CI settings
(`.github/workflows/`), `docker-compose.yml`, the database schema and
migration folders, the main source folders, the test folders and their
shared helpers (for *Tests* in `CLAUDE.md`), `.gitignore`. Don't change
anything yet.

Note how much the project already does beyond its starter files. This
decides how much weight the code carries in the interview.

### 4. Interview the user

The goal is to learn four things well enough to write
`docs/architecture.md` and `docs/project-phase-plan.md`: the business
logic, the data model, the high-level architecture, and the phases.

Ask the three rounds below, one round per message, and wait for the
answers before the next round. Use earlier answers to make later questions
concrete (e.g. name the entities you heard about in round 1). The user
can say "skip" to any question; note skipped questions for *Open
questions*.

**Use the code.** Offer a suggested answer wherever the code or the
existing docs show one, so the user can reply "yes".

- When the project is mostly starter files, the code shows little about
  the business, so the answers are the main source for the design.
- When the project already has real work in it, check each answer
  against the code. Where they differ, say what the code shows and ask
  which is right. If the code is right, use it. If the answer describes
  what is intended but not built yet, use the answer and list the
  difference under *Open questions*. Never settle a difference silently.

**Round 1: The app**

1. What's the project called, and what will the app do? What problem does
   it solve?
2. Who will use it? List the types of users (e.g. customer, staff, admin),
   what each one can do, and whether they need to sign in.
3. Walk through the most important thing a user does, step by step, from
   start to finish.

**Round 2: Data and rules**

4. What things does the app keep track of, and how are they connected?
   (e.g. a customer has one or more reservations, and each reservation is
   for one table) Mention the key details of each, such as a
   reservation's date, time and party size.
5. What rules does the app follow? Think of limits, statuses, prices,
   deadlines and who may do what. (e.g. a reservation can be cancelled up
   to 24 hours before)
6. Does the app store anything sensitive, such as personal details,
   payments or health data?

**Round 3: Shape and scope**

7. Where will people use it: in a web browser, as a phone app, both, or
   only as an API or script?
8. Does it need outside services, such as payments, email or SMS, maps,
   AI, or sign-in with Google?
9. What phase is the project in now, and what must that phase include?
   What comes after it, and what can wait for later? (For a project with
   real work in it, suggest a first phase that sums up what's built.)

Ask follow-up questions only where an answer leaves the data model or the
core flow unclear. Keep them few.

### 5. Play back and confirm

Show the user a short summary and ask them to confirm or correct it:

- the entities and how they connect, as a Mermaid `erDiagram`
- the core flow as numbered steps
- the tech stack, as found in the project's files
- the phases: what the current phase includes, and what comes in which
  later phase
- any differences between the answers and the code, and how each was
  settled

Don't write anything until the user confirms. Apply corrections and play
back again if they change the data model or the phases.

### 6. Write the design docs

Create two files from the templates next to this one. Fill in every
section from the confirmed answers and the code. Put anything skipped or
still unclear under *Open questions* instead of guessing. Remove the
template comments, then check that no `{{` or `}}` is left.

- `docs/architecture.md` from `architecture-template.md`.
- `docs/project-phase-plan.md` from `phase-plan-template.md`. Keep it a
  high-level blueprint: goals and scope per phase, no task lists.

If either file already exists, ask before replacing it, and carry over
anything in it that is still true.

### 7. Fill in CLAUDE.md

Go through every `{{placeholder}}` in `claude-template.md`. Fill in each
one the files or the confirmed answers answer clearly. Use real commands
and paths from the project. Don't guess. Sum up the *Overview* in
`docs/architecture.md` in one or two sentences for the description, and
take the stack from the project's files.

If there is an old `CLAUDE.md`:

- Use its information to fill in placeholders.
- Keep any rule or note from it that has no place in the template. Put it
  in the section where it fits best, or under *Other guidance*.
- If it disagrees with the project's files (e.g. a command that no longer
  exists), trust the files and note the difference for step 9.

Put every placeholder you couldn't fill into **one** short numbered list
of questions. Give a suggested answer wherever you have one, so the user
can reply "yes". Remove a line when it doesn't apply to the project, or
the user doesn't know the answer; note unanswered ones for step 9.

Remove a whole section only when it doesn't apply to the project (e.g.
*Database migrations* when there is no database). Never remove a section
because an answer is missing: other files refer to the headings by name.
If a kept section ends up with no lines, write "Not set yet." under its
heading and note it for step 9.

Always keep the *Source of truth* section, naming `docs/architecture.md`
and `docs/project-phase-plan.md`.

### 8. Write CLAUDE.md

Save `CLAUDE.md` in the project root, replacing the old one if there is
one. Remove every template comment, including the "how to use this
file" comment at the top. Then check that no `{{`, `}}` or `<!--` is
left anywhere in the file.

### 9. Report, then stop

Tell the user, in a short list:

1. That `CLAUDE.md` is ready, and what it now says the project is.
2. That `docs/architecture.md` holds the design and
   `docs/project-phase-plan.md` the phases, and which phase is current.
   They are a snapshot as of today. The code is the source of truth and
   will move ahead of them as features are built.
3. Any differences between the answers and the code that were left under
   *Open questions*.
4. If there was an old `CLAUDE.md`: what was carried over, and anything
   left out because the project's files showed it was out of date.
5. Which sections were removed, and which questions were left
   unanswered, so they can add them later.
6. That `claude-template.md` isn't needed any more: delete it now, before
   committing. Don't delete it yourself.
7. What to do next:
   - After deleting `claude-template.md`, commit everything before
     anything else; `/feature implement` stops if anything besides a
     spec is uncommitted. If the project
     isn't in a GitHub repository yet, commit everything on `main` (the
     exception in Team rule 1 of `claude-context/project-git-workflow.md`), then
     create the repository on GitHub and push `main`. Otherwise commit
     everything on a
     new branch (e.g. `setup`) and open a PR, following Part 1 of
     `claude-context/project-git-workflow.md`. Wait until a teammate has merged
     it, then `git checkout main` and `git pull --ff-only`: until then
     `main` doesn't have the skills or `CLAUDE.md`.
   - `/feature describe "<what you want>"` starts a new feature.

<!--
Adding setup steps later: add each one as a new numbered step before
"Report, then stop", with a heading that says in plain words what it
does. Add a matching line to "What this does" at the top.
