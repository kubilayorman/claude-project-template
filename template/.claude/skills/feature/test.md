# /feature test

## When this runs

Invoked as `/feature test`, after `/feature implement` has finished and
the user has tried the feature by hand. Writes unit tests for the
feature on its branch and runs the test suite. This is the only
`/feature` action that writes or runs tests.

## Before running anything

Check the current branch. If it is `main`, stop: there is no feature
branch to test. The spec is `claude-context/<current-branch>-spec.md`.
If it doesn't exist, stop and ask. Then look at its **Status**:

- `New` → stop: the feature hasn't been built yet. Point the user to
  `/feature implement`.
- `Implemented` → go through all the steps below.
- `Tested` → the tests are already written (e.g. `/feature finalize`
  sent the user back here after bringing in teammates' changes). Skip to
  step 4 and run them, unless the user asks for more tests.
- `PR created` → stop and point the user to Part 2 of
  `claude-context/project-git-workflow.md`.

Read `CLAUDE.md`, `claude-context/ai-interaction.md`, the spec, the
code the feature added or changed (`git diff origin/main...HEAD`), and
the project's existing tests, if not already fresh in context. Every git
command follows the same rule as the other actions: show the exact
command, wait for a go-ahead. Never add a `Co-Authored-By` line for
Claude or any AI tool.

## Steps

1. **Pick what's worth testing.** Unit tests only, and only for the
   parts of the feature where a mistake could slip through unnoticed:
   business rules, calculations, validation, permissions, status
   changes, edge cases and error handling. Skip code that only passes
   data along, sets up config or layout, or calls a framework or library
   without logic of its own. The spec's test notes under *Feature
   technical requirements* are a starting point, not a must-do list. If
   nothing in the feature is worth unit testing, say so and propose no
   tests.
2. **Show the test plan and wait for approval.** A table with one row
   per test, in the plain-language style of `ai-interaction.md`, written
   so a non-technical reader can follow it:

   | # | What we check | Why it matters | Example |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | 1 | An expired reset link is rejected | Old links shouldn't work forever | A link from 2 days ago shows "Link expired" |

   Below the table, list in one line each what you chose not to test and
   why. Say which file the tests go in (see step 3). Don't write any
   test until the user approves; apply their changes to the plan first.
3. **Write the tests.** Put them where *Tests* in `CLAUDE.md` says,
   following its naming, and reuse the shared helpers and fixtures it
   names. If `CLAUDE.md` doesn't say, follow where the project's
   existing tests live, and mention it.
4. **Run the tests.** Start any local services listed under *Commands*
   in `CLAUDE.md`. If the project has a *Database migrations* section,
   apply all migrations. Then run the test command under *Checks* in
   `CLAUDE.md`, the whole suite, not only the new tests.

   If a test fails, find out whether the test or the feature's code is
   wrong. Explain it in plain language, propose the fix, and wait for a
   go-ahead. Fixing the feature's code is allowed here: it's a bug the
   test found. After each fix, rerun the whole suite. Keep iterating
   until everything passes. Don't change a test just to make it pass
   when the test is right.
5. **Record the result in the spec.** Change **Status** to `Tested` and
   fill in **Test results**: the counts from the last run and the new
   test file(s), e.g. `42 passed (5 new, in tests/test_password_reset.py)`.
6. **Commit.** Run `git status`, check the file list against *Never
   commit* in `CLAUDE.md`, then show the exact `git add -A` and commit
   commands and wait for approval.
7. **Stop.** Tell the user the tests pass and that `/feature finalize`
   is next. Don't push or open a PR.
